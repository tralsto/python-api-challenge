# python-api-challenge
In this module, the task at hand was to show our proficiency with utilizing APIs and calling them within Python.

For this assignment I analyzed 500+ cities across the globe. The dataset can change everytime you run the code again so the results, graphs, and maps can different based on the data pulled from the API catalog. This can cause some correlations to visibly look stronger or weaker depending on the cities included in the overall analysis.

For Part 1: WeatherPy I utilized the free API Key from OpenWeatherMap API. For Part 2: VacationPy I utilized the free API Key from Geoapify API and data from the CitiPy Python library.

This assignment ultimately allowed me to analyze cities based on weather criteria I set and then found according Hotels nearest to the desired location.
